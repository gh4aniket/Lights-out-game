# 🔦 Lights Out Game (React)

Lights Out is a puzzle game where the goal is to turn off all the lights on the board. This version is built using **React**, showcasing component-based design, state management, and simple logic implementation in an interactive UI.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

The game starts with a grid of lights. Some are **on**, and some are **off** (highlighted visually). Clicking a light **toggles** its state (on/off) as well as the state of its **immediate neighbors** (up, down, left, right). 

The objective is to **turn off all the lights** — when every tile is off, you win the game!
